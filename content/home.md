## **Hi, I'm Alan Zhou**

I'm a rising senior in high school. My interests mainly lie in physics & ECE.  
In particular, I'm interested in computer systems/architectures,  
and the potential applications of physics in improving efficiency and creating new types of computers. 



**This is a website to store some projects/research/stuff that I have worked on.**  
Nothing here will be too interesting.

I don't actively use any social media, but you can find my github [here](https://github.com/ZhouA25).   
There shouldn't be too much on there either, it should only contain some code for my BU RISE project.  
However the code is kind of a mess and not all the images I generated, or powertraces/outputs used to get the images, are in the repo.
